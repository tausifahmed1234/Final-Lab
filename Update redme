Lab Instructions: Image Classification with Caltech-101 Dataset
and Explainability using Grad-CAM

Objective
To build, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image
classification using the Caltech-101 dataset. Students will also learn to apply
Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically Grad-CAM, to visualize model
decision-making.

Prerequisites
• Basic knowledge of Python programming.
• Familiarity with machine learning and deep learning concepts.
• Understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
• Basic knowledge of Explainable AI (XAI).

Part 1: Introduction to Caltech-101 Dataset
Dataset Overview
• Caltech-101 contains images from 101 object categories and 1 background category.
• Images per category range from 40 to 800, with a total of approximately 9,146 images.
• Images are diverse in size and can be resized for consistency.
Task
• Classify images into one of the 101 categories using a CNN.
• Visualize model decision-making using Grad-CAM.
